								<h1>raising steer<br />

								<p>Hello! My name is Sofia Larson. I am a 16-year-old homeschool student with a passion for agriculture. I'm a proud member of Greensleeves 4-H, Wranglers 4-H, and the American Rabbit Breeders Association. This year, my 4-H projects include beef, rabbits, swine, photography, gardening, bees, and veterinary science. Last year, I even showed llamas. My goal is to earn a degree in agriculture or veterinary medicine. Ultimately, I want to become a cattle farmer.</p>
								<p>I am excited to participate in my first <a href="https://www.evergreenfair.org/252/Evergreen-Youth-Livestock-Show" target="_blank">Youth Livestock Show and Sale</a>. I will be showcasing and selling my market steer, Lark (ear tag #10), on August 24th at 5 pm at the Fairgrounds in Monroe.</p>

							<p>Lark is a grain-finished Angus/Aberdeen market steer from <a href="https://www.fraidknotfarm.com" target="_blank">Fraid Knot Farms</a> in Monroe, Washington. Since December, I have been working with Lark several times a week, focusing on halter training, grooming, walking, and showmanship. Lark is well behaved for me and loves treats! In March, Lark weighed approximately 1,200 pounds. The goal is for him to exceed 1,450 pounds by 18 months. He has access to haylage, alfalfa, and clean water at all times. Lark is on a carefully constructed grain feed plan, as well.</p>
							<p>As a hands-on learner, this project has been invaluable for gaining practical farming experience. It has been a privilege to help with the calves and heifers on the farm as well as to be invited to help herd and observe during hoof trimming and veterinary care. Fraid Knot Farms has taught me to treat cattle calmly and kindly, which not only benefits the steer but also contributes to better-tasting beef.</p>
							<p>I have dedicated significant effort and fully funded this project on my own. I am reaching out to potential supporters to help offset the costs of feed, grooming, and training supplies, as well as the initial purchase price of the steer. Proceeds exceeding $4,000 from the sale will help fund my college education and also allow me to attend the <a href="https://www.cattlemanulive.com/shes-a-hand-ranch-camp-summer-camp" target="_blank">"She's a Ranch Hand" Camp</a> in Montana next summer, where I can gain even more hands-on experience in ranching.</p>
							<div class="image main"><img src="images/sofia-steer-23.jpg" alt="sofia and the steet" /></div>
							<p>I hope you will consider supporting my project, and if possible, attend the Evergreen Youth Livestock Show and Sale on August 24th to bid on Lark. Your time and support mean the world to me, and I would be grateful for any assistance you can provide. I invite you to follow my journey on Instagram and Facebook at “Sofia and The Steer."</p>
